18,Hypotheses,Hypotheses,"Climatic variables have been frequently suggested as determinants of regional-scale distributions of plants [@Kreft2007; @Qian2022]. Specific environmental variables that determine the distribution of selected tree species were unknown. Therefore, this study used the 19 bioclimatic variables that have been frequently included to model species distribution [@Bobrowski2021; @Guisan2017]. However, this study did not include elevation, slope, and aspect as predictors because they were inferred to be only indirectly related to the distribution and physiology of plants [@Korner2007]. Further, topographic heterogeneity may be less important than the climatic factors at larger scales."
19,Assumptions,Model assumptions,Relevant ecological drivers (or proxies) are included; Species are at (pseudo-) equilibrium with their environment; Sampling is adequate and representative (and any biases are accounted for/corrected); The correlation structure between predictors does not change between source and target landscape; The model extrapolates in a biologically sensible manner; Detectability does not change across habitat gradients; Species are adequately and correctly identified
20,Algorithms,Modeling techniques,"MaxEnt was chosen due to its competitive performance on small sample sizes and ease of use, and its outputs were approximated to true probabilities using published equations."
21,Algorithms,Model complexity,"Linear, Quadratic, and hinge features were used. The product and threshold features will be used if the number of presences exceeds 80 under the default settings. Model settings were chosen to yield intermediately complex response surfaces but prevent excessive overfitting."
22,Algorithms,Model ensembles,We combined the 12 models (3 pseudo-absence sets &times; 4 cross-validation runs) to ensemble model predictions using the committee averaging (EMca) and weighted mean (EMwmean) algorithms.
23,Workflow,Model workflow,"Compiled species occurrences were cleaned and pre-processed to minimize the bias. Variables with a VIF greater than 10 were considered correlated [@Guisan2017] and excluded from further analysis to minimize the bias due to multicollinearity among predictors [@Dormann2013]. This VIF-based variable selection identified six bioclimatic variables: bio2, bio3, bio8, bio14, bio15, and bio18. Un-tuned MaxEnt models were used because this study sought to model multiple species simultaneously, and it was impractical to build species-specific tuned models [@Merow2013]. We build 12 individual models (3 pseudo-absence sets &times; 4 cross-validation runs) and two ensemble models for each species. The predictive accuracy of models was evaluated using the true skill statistic (TSS) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC~ROC~). The presence-absence maps were analyzed to investigate the predicted changes in suitable habitat, elevational distribution, range dynamics, and species richness."
24,Software,Software,The MaxEnt models were implemented in the R statistical environment version 4.3.1 [@R-base] using the `biomod2` package version 4.2.4 [@R-biomod2] together with the standalone java-based MaxEnt software version 3.4.3 [@Phillips2006].

62,Variable pre-selection,Variable pre-selection,"We identified six bioclimatic variables based on the variance inflation factor.

Further, we deemed topographic heterogeneity less important than the climatic factors at regional scales."

70,Model estimates,Variable importance,"Each environmental variable was shuffled, and model predictions were computed using the shuffled variable to estimate the importance of environmental variables [@R-biomod2; @Thuiller2009]. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was calculated between the reference predictions and the predictions from the shuffled variable. The final variable importance score is calculated by subtracting Pearson's correlation from one (1 - r)."
71,Model ensembles,Model selection,"Ensemble models were built for each species to summarise the performances of the 12 individual models (3 pseudo-absence sets &times; 4 cross-validation runs). Since the performance of the ensemble model depends on the quality of individual models, a threshold TSS score of 0.7 was used to exclude low-quality models (TSS < 0.7), perform binary transformation for EMca (presence = TSS > 0.7 and absence = TSS < 0.7) and define model weights for EMwmean [@Nikkel2023]. "
72,Model ensembles,Ensemble methods,"Two popular methods were used for building ensemble models [@Hao2019]: committee averaging (EMca) and weighted mean (EMwmean). The EMca approach first transforms the probabilities from selected models into the binary species presence (1) and absence (0) based on a threshold defined by maximizing the evaluation metric score on a testing dataset. Then, it takes the average of binary predictions from all selected models. Thus, the committee averaging a score of 0 or 1 means all models agree, whereas any values between 0 and 1 indicate at least one model disagrees with predictions. On the other hand, the EMwmeans approach weights the probabilities from each model based on the evaluation score and then sums all the probabilities. The individual model with better performance receives higher weight and, therefore, has higher importance in the ensemble. "
